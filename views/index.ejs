                    Beer is one of the oldest[1][2][3] and most widely
                    consumed[4] alcoholic drinks in the world, and the third
                    most popular drink overall after water and tea.[5]<br/> Beer is
                    brewed from cereal grainsâ€”most commonly from malted barley,
                    though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During
                    the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in
                    the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting
                    beer.[6]<br/> Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add
                    bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural
                    preservative and stabilizing&nbsp;agent. 
                </p>

                <p class="col-sm history-column">
                    Other flavouring agents
                    such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used
                    instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural
                    carbonation effect is often removed during processing and
                    replaced with forced carbonation.[7]<br/>
                    Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the
                    production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi
                    included laws regulating beer and beer parlours,[8]<br/> and "The
                    Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of
                    beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering
                    the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate
                    people.[9][10]
                </p>

                <p class="col-sm-12 history-column">
                    Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly
                    available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The
                    brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several
                    dominant multinational companies and many thousands of
                    smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional
                    breweries. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4%
                    to 6% alcohol by volume (ABV), although it may vary between
                    0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40%
                    ABV and above.[11]

                    Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is
                    associated with social traditions such as beer festivals, as
                    well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub
                    crawling and pub games.
